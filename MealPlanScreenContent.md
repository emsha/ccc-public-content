In an effort to foster community and simplify what otherwise would be a headache of a system, the CCC Meal Plan is included with every booking by default. 

The plan works like this: 

  - tell us any requests for ingredients
  - we stock the kitchen
  - you cook and eat the food

The benefits of discouraging individual food stashes are:

  - more efficient use of food storage space
  - encouraging group meals and participation in family dinners
  - avoiding tantrums that may start thusly: "hey did you eat those grapes? THOSE WERE MY GRAPES"

We are happy to accomodate any dietary restrictions.

The only time we would consider recommending someone be seperate from the meal plan is if they have extremely specific dietary needs. In any case, we'd recommend you talk with us first before opting out of the meal plan. Again, we are very accommodating and will do everything we can to help you participate in the plan.
